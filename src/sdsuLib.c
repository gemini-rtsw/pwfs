 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   SDSU Detector Controller Interface Library
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   The SDSU detector controller VxWorks library, which provides an interface
 *   to the San Diego State University (SDSU) detector controller system.
 *
 *   This library provides functions for sending commands to the SDSU 
 *   controller, reading back the responses and data, defining various detector 
 *   control parameters, reading and writing DSP memory, downloading and 
 *   uploading configuration files, plus various diagnostic functions, as 
 *   listed below. Further details of the SDSU controller hardware, firmware 
 *   and DSP interface are contained in the "SDSU CCD Controller User's Manual",
 *   (Bob Leach and Frank Beale, SDSU, 1994). The low level SDSU detector
 *   controller interface used by the AGWPS is described in ICD 1.6/1.10.
 *
 *   Portability
 *   -----------
 *   The library has been written to be as portable as is reasonably possible.
 *   However, certain function calls make use of target-specific hardware
 *   resources which are not fully supported by the VxWorks BSP (e.g. some
 *   accesses to VME and on-board peripherals such as the high-resolution
 *   timers).
 *   It was originally claimed that portability had been maximised through the
 *   use of the extended system library, sysextLib (an extension to the mv167
 *   and hk4700 BSP sysLib libraries). However, sysextLib itself has proved to 
 *   be highly non-portable and more trouble than it is worth, and it can been
 *   removed from this library by defining the NO_SYSEXTLIB macro when 
 *   compiling it.
 *
 *   Shared Code and Re-Entrancy
 *   ---------------------------
 *   It is a requirement that a single processor can control an arbitrary number
 *   of SDSU controllers in the Gemini system. This requires that care be taken
 *   to ensure that the sdsuLib library can be shared by a number of tasks on
 *   the same processor, and that the code is re-entrant. Section 3.3.9 of the
 *   "VxWorks Programmer's Guide (version 5.2)" contains a general discussion
 *   on shared code and reentrancy in VxWorks.
 *
 *   In order to meet this requirement, each SDSU controller has an associated
 *   data structure used to store all static variables associated with the
 *   controller. The structure is called the "context" (typedef SDSU_CONTEXT).
 *   A single context structure is usually declared only once for each 
 *   controller and a handle to the structure may subsequently be used by any 
 *   tasks which make calls to sdsuLib.
 *
 *   It is also possible to declare multiple contexts for a single controller
 *   system, and thereby allow a number of independent application programs to
 *   share access to a single set of controller hardware. An example of the
 *   way in which multiple contexts might be required is to allow both an
 *   EPICS-based application program and a pure VxWorks application to control
 *   a single SDSU controller. It should be noted that the use of multiple
 *   contexts requires appropriate calls to sdsuLib in order to ensure that each
 *   context structure is maintained correctly.
 *
 *   The sdsuLib library provides mutual-excusion mechanisms which may be used
 *   to ensure that only one process can make physical access to an SDSU
 *   controller at any instance. The use of these functions is generally
 *   recommended whenever more than once task is required to access the same
 *   controller hardware. The exclusion functions can be used by multiple tasks
 *   on a single processor or by multiple tasks on multiple processors.
 *
 *   DSP Code
 *   --------
 *   The SDSU system makes extensive use of internal Digital Signal Processor
 *   (DSP) firmware and software. A number of downloadable DSP program modules
 *   will be made available as extensions to the basic system, and it is assumed
 *   that these are installed on the VxWorks host machine and are available to
 *   the sdsuLib library

 *
 *
 *   DEFICIENCIES:
 *   This library uses a polling method for detecting a reply from the SDSU 
 *   controller, and the algorithm used can get confused if the controller is 
 *   reset unexpectedly and the timing board generates an SYR. The algorithm 
 *   can also get confused if some legitimate data just happens to contain ERR 
 *   or SYR byte sequences.
 *
 *   Many of the timing parameters used by this library, such as the wait time 
 *   while polling for a reply, the time to wait for a controller reset, and 
 *   the timeouts used for the various commands, have been set arbitrarily.
 *
 *   I think the algorithm for reading out data from an SDSU controller, 
 *   involving a message queue, an interrupt, various semaphores, a readout 
 *   task and a signal handler, is more complicated than it needs to be. Having 
 *   several threads makes handling errors difficult.

 *   This routine must be called before sdsuLib can be used to execute any
 *   commands which involve communication with SDSU controller hardware. It 
 *   returns the context ID (a pointer to a structure) which is subsequently 
 *   used to maintain information about the status of the controller, including  *   the circular reply buffer and various configuration & status data. The 
 *   context ID ensures that sdsuLib is re-entrant since it holds all data 
 *   specific to a given controller: multiple controllers may therefore use 
 *   sdsuLib on a single CPU under VxWorks providing that each has a unique 
 *   context ID.
 *   After initialising the context ID with this routine it is necessary to
 *   reset the SDSU controller and issue a "Set Reply Address" (SRA) command
 *   to the SDSU controller at the specified VME address, which resets the VME
 *   DSP's reply address to point to the circular buffer that was allocated by
 *   this routine. This may be done by calling
 *v
 *v      sdsuReset (context, SDSU_RESET_VME | SDSU_RESET_CONTROLLER);
 *v
 *
 *   The "simulate" flag may be set TRUE to test the operation of sdsuLib in
 *   the absence of the SDSU controller hardware.

 *
 *   POST REQUIREMENTS:
 *   IMPORTANT. After calling this function sdsuSetReplyAddress() needs to be

 *   to the interface reset address which is 4 bytes above the base address
 *   of the board.  An "SRA" command is then issued to re-program the reply 
 *   address in the VME interface. Finally (and irrespective of whether a VME 
 *   board reset has been issued), if the SDSU_RESET_CONTROLLER bit of 'what' 
 *   is set then an "RRS" command is issued to the VME DSP.  This is a Gemini
 *   custom boot command which causes a special bit-pattern to be sent down 
 *   the fibre and results in the remote DSPs being reset.
 *
 *   NOTE:
 *   The DSP code will need to be redownloaded after executing this function.
 *   The timing board also needs to receive an LDP command after being reset,
 *   and the utility board needs to receive a INI command.

 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Execute diagnostic tests of SDSU controller
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine executes a suite of pre-programmed tests on an SDSU controller
 *   system. The tests may be performed on one or more of the installed DSPs in
 *   the controller, according to the bit-field dspIdentMask as shown in the
 *   following table.
 *   
 *      Bit-0   =>   VME DSP
 *      Bit-1   =>   Timing DSP
 *      Bit-2   =>   Utility DSP
 *
 *   For example, if dspIdentMask is 0x05 then the Utility and VME DSPs will be
 *   tested; if dspIdentMask is 0x02 then only the Timing DSP will be tested.
 *
 *   The scope of the tests performed on each DSP is determined by the bit-field
 *   pointed to by pTestMask. Application code should generate this bit-field by
 *   ORing together any combination of the following macros.
 *
 *      SDSU_TEST_LINK  =>   Enables TDL test with varying data pattern
 *      SDSU_TEST_RDM   =>   Enables RDM from the first and last location in
 *                           each memory space
 *      SDSU_TEST_WRM   =>   Enables WRM to the first and last location in
 *                           X and Y (but not P) memory space
 *
 *   The contents of pTestMask on return from this routine reflect the result 
 *   of the tests performed - in the event of successful tests then *pTestMask 
 *   is set to zero, while if either test fails then the corresponding bit in 
 *   *pTestMask (as defined in the above table) will be set. Note that the 
 *   tests are aborted immediately on detection of an error so that only one 
 *   bit in *pTestMask should ever be set on return. Also, in the event that 
 *   more than one DSP is tested (more than one bit in dspIdentMask set on 
 *   entry to this routine), then if an error is detected in one of the tests 
 *   there is no way of determining which DSP failed the given test.
 *   In this case it is necessary to separately test each DSP in order to locate
 *   the error.

 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine is analogous to the VxWorks routine d() provided in usrLib. It
 *   allows a range of DSP memory locations to be read and displayed in
 *   hexadecimal and ascii format at the VxWorks console. The routine accepts
 *   its arguments in a versatile way - ptr specifies the starting address to
 *   display, and, if ptr includes a valid address-space identifier in the upper
 *   nibble of the 24-bit address (see the SDSU hardware manual), then 
 *   pMemSpace is ignored. If the upper nibble of ptr is zero, then the string 
 *   at pMemSpace identifies the required memory space and should be one of 
 *   "x", "y", "p" or "e" corresponding to X, Y, program and EEPROM memory 
 *   spaces respectively. nWord gives the number of 24-bit DSP words to display 
 *   starting from address ptr. destId identifies the target DSP to access - 
 *   this can be a valid DSP ID (see table below) or may point to a string 
 *   containing one of "v", "t" or "u" corresponding to the VME, Timing or

 *   FUNCTION VALUE:
 *   (STATUS)  OK, or ERROR if the memory could not be modified.
 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Read DSP memory and modify at the VxWorks console
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine is analogous to the VxWorks routine m() provided in usrLib. It
 *   allows a range of DSP memory locations to be read, displayed and modified
 *   The routine accepts
 *   its arguments in a versatile way - ptr specifies the starting address to
 *   modify, and, if ptr includes a valid address-space identifier in the upper
 *   nibble of the 24-bit address (see the SDSU hardware manual), then pMemSpace
 *   is ignored. If the upper nibble of ptr is zero, then the string at 
 *   pMemSpace identifies the required memory space and should be one of "x", 
 *   "y", "p" or "e"
 *   corresponding to X, Y, program and EEPROM memory spaces respectively. 
 *   destId identifies the target DSP to access - this can be a valid DSP ID 
 *   (see table below) or may point to a string containing one of "v", "t" or 
 *   "u" corresponding to the VME, Timing or Utility DSP respectively.
 *
 *      SDSU_IDENT_HST   =>   Refers to the host CPU
 *      SDSU_IDENT_VME   =>   Refers to VME DSP
 *      SDSU_IDENT_TIM   =>   Refers to Timing DSP
 *      SDSU_IDENT_UTL   =>   Refers to Utility DSP
 *
 *   The routine stores the last set of parameters which were successfully 
 *   employed in a set of static variables and substitutes these for any entry 
 *   parameters which are either zero or NULL. This allows the second and 
 *   subsequent calls to the routine to advance through DSP memory. Similarly, 
 *   in many cases parameters such as the context ID need only be specified the 
 *   first time the routine is invoked. Note, however, that in order to allow

 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Print contents of SDSU circular reply buffer
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine prints the SDSU circular reply buffer at the VxWorks console.
 *   The buffer is cleared by sdsuLib when it wraps over and the current buffer
 *   pointer, i.e. the location to which the next reply word is expected to be  
 *   written bracketed by left- and right-angle brackets ('>' and '<'). Those 
 *   buffer locations which contain recognisable SDSU reply words are displayed 
 *   as ASCII strings, all other words are in hexadecimal format.
 *
 *   The most significant byte of each reply word (which is not used by the SDSU
 *   hardware) is set to 0xff whenever the word contains data written by the 
 *   SDSU DSP which has not yet been read by the VxWorks software. These words 
 *   are bracketed by '!' characters. If the word at the reply buffer pointer 
 *   is flagged in this way it is bracketed by '*' instead of '>' and '<'.
 *
 *   EXAMPLE:
 *v      sdsuPrintRepBuf ctx

 *v      SDSU Reply Buffer

 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Execute SDSU primitive command
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine executes an SDSU primitive command. It combines the routines
 *   sdsuPrimitiveWrite() and sdsuPrimitiveRead(), and takes as the command 
 *   definition a 3-character (plus null) string which holds the command 
 *   mnemonic, e.g. "RDM" to read DSP memory. The source of the command is by 
 *   definition always the host processor but the destination is determined by 
 *   destId which must be a valid DSP ID taken from the table below. Command 
 *   arguments are contained in the array pCmdArg and any returned values are 
 *   copied to pRepArg. Either of these two pointers may be NULL if there are 
 *   no arguments.
 *
 *      SDSU_IDENT_HST   =>   Refers to the host CPU
 *      SDSU_IDENT_VME   =>   Refers to VME DSP
 *      SDSU_IDENT_TIM   =>   Refers to Timing DSP
 *      SDSU_IDENT_UTL   =>   Refers to Utility DSP
 *
 *   ATOMICITY OF PRIMITIVE COMMANDS:
 *   This routine uses a mutex semaphore contained within the SDSU context 
 *   strucuture to ensure that primitive commands are executed atomically. 
 *   This is potentially important where, for example, more than one VxWorks 
 *   task may issue commands to the same controller. Such a situation is somwhat
 *   dangerous, however a more likely scenario is one in which a user needs to 
 *   issue commands from a VxWorks console (e.g. in order to determine the 
 *   state of a controller) while a separate VxWorks task is also issuing 
 *   commands. Note that there are no exclusion mechanisms for applications in 
 *   which primitive commands are issued to a single SDSU controller from 
 *   different VxWorks CPUs, since in this case each CPU will have a separate
 *   mutex semaphore within its own context structure. Such an application 
 *   requires inter-CPU communications to provide exclusive to each CPU at 
 *   any instant.
 *
 *   PRIMITIVE COMMANDS:
 *   A primitive command must be recognised by sdsuLib for it to send it. The 
 *   fact that a command is recognised does not, however, guarantee that the
 *   command is supported by the downloaded SDSU software or firmware - this 
 *   must be determined from examination of the specific system installation.

 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Download data from a OMF file (".lod" format) to an SDSU DSP
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine downloads DSP56k object code from a OMF file to
 *   a specified DSP in the SDSU controller system. destId can take one
 *   of the values specified in the table below.
 *
 *      SDSU_IDENT_HST   =>   Refers to the host CPU
 *      SDSU_IDENT_VME   =>   Refers to VME DSP
 *      SDSU_IDENT_TIM   =>   Refers to Timing DSP
 *      SDSU_IDENT_UTL   =>   Refers to Utility DSP
 *
 *   The OMF file will normally be the output from the Motorola utility
 *   program "cldlod". The arrays pStart and pFinish define the starting and
 *   finishing DSP addresses to which data may be downloaded for each of the
 *   DSP56k's memory spaces (X, Y and P space); these address ranges therefore
 *   allow a mask to be applied to the OMF file such that only certain
 *   memory spaces, and/or a limited range of addresses within each space
 *   are over-written.
 *
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   None
 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   The OMF file must have been opened before this routine is called.
 *
 *   REFERENCES:
 *   A description of the OMF file structure can be found in Chapter 6
 *   of the Motorola DSP Simulator Reference Manual, "DSP Object Module
 *   Format", Published by Motorola 1992.

 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Upload data from an SDSU DSP to a OMF file (".lod" format)
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine uploads DSP56k object code from a specified DSP
 *   in the SDSU controller system and writes the code to a file
 *   in OMF format. This file format is compatible with that produced
 *   by the Motorola utility program "cldlod". The arrays pStart and
 *   pFinish define the starting and finishing addresses from which
 *   data will be uploaded for each of the DSP56k's memory spaces (X,
 *   Y and P space). No data will be uploaded from any memory spaces
 *   for which the start address is larger than the finish address.
 *   destId can take one of the values specified in the table below.
 *
 *      SDSU_IDENT_HST   =>   Refers to the host CPU
 *      SDSU_IDENT_VME   =>   Refers to VME DSP
 *      SDSU_IDENT_TIM   =>   Refers to Timing DSP
 *      SDSU_IDENT_UTL   =>   Refers to Utility DSP
 *
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   None
 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   The OMF file must have been opened before this routine is called.
 *
 *   REFERENCES:
 *   A description of the OMF file structure can be found in Chapter 6
 *   of the Motorola DSP Simulator Reference Manual, "DSP Object Module

 *   FUNCTION VALUE:

 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Download data from a OMF file (".lod" format) to an SDSU DSP
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine downloads DSP56k object code from a OMF file to
 *   a specified DSP in the SDSU controller system. The OMF file will
 *   normally be the output from the Motorola utility program "cldlod".
 *   The routine provides similar functionality to sdsuMemoryDnload()
 *   but with a slightly higher-level interface. In this case the
 *   OMF file is opened by the routine so that only the file name is
 *   required. If limitAdrsRange is FALSE the entire OMF file will be
 *   downloaded, while if limitAdrsRange is TRUE the user will be
 *   prompted to enter (at standard input) the starting and finishing
 *   addresses for each DSP memory space (see sdsuMemoryDnload()). A
 *   further difference between this routine and sdsuMemoryDnload() is
 *   that in this case the P memory space is always downloaded in two
 *   stages - during the first pass through the file only those P-space
 *   addresses larger than  minimum value, Pmin, are downloaded, then,
 *   on a second pass through the file any P-space addresses which lie
 *   below Pmin are downloaded. This feature is provided to cope with
 *   situations in which a DSP's interrupt vector table (which occurs
 *   at addresses < Pmin) may need to be over-written only AFTER
 *   one or more corresponding interrupt service routines have been
 *   installed at addresses >= Pmin. Pmin is given by the macro
 *   SDSU_LOW_DNLOAD_ADRS_IN_P, which is defined in the file sdsuLib.h
 *   destId can take one of the values specified in the table below.

 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine finds a spare frame from the previously created data buffer 
 *   and returns a pointer to it.  Frames are managed on a free-list, so the
 *   next free frame is obtained without having to perform a linear search of
 *   the pool.  If a timeout is specified the function will wait until a spare
 *   frame becomes available, or until the timeout elapses, if it does not 
 *   find a frame free immediately. The function will not wait if NO_WAIT is 
 *   specified and will wait forever if WAIT_FOREVER is specified.
 *
 *   sdsuFrameFind is available for applications which use their own custom
 *   readout task. Applications which use the standard sdsuLib readout task,
 *   (started by calling sdsuReadoutOpen) do not need to use sdsuFrameFind at 
 *   all, as it will be called automatically by the readout task before each 
 *   frame callback.
 *
 *   EXAMPLE:
 *v
 *v  sdsuFrameFind    - Finds a frame (called by readout task)
 *v  sdsuFrameReserve - Reserves the frame (application code)
 *v  sdsuFrameReserve - Reserves the frame again (application code)
 *v  sdsuFrameRelease - Reduces the reservation count (application code)
 *v  sdsuFrameRelease - Reduces the reservation count again (application code)

 *
 *   This function assumes that any error from semTake() means that the

 *   This is the task entry point for the readout task which handles all the

 *   
 *   If not NULL, the packetCall is executed by the task whenever more data

 *   allowed to spend as much elapsed time as it likes processing the packet 
 *   data, although on average the processing time must not exceed the time 
 *   between readouts or the system will run out of image buffers. When the 
 *   frame has been received the frameCall routine is run (omitted if this is 
 *   NULL).
 *   
 *   NB if a frame has been completely received before the readout task starts
 *   to process it, the packetCall routine will never be run for that frame,
 *   thus the frameCall must be able to completely handle the processing of the
 *   frame data.  The application is responsible for checking the parameterId
 *   field of the frame and working out how much data has been received at any
 *   time, based on the packetCount and its knowledge of the packet size.

 *   IGNORED FUNCTION NAME:
 *   sdsu_readSignal
 *
 *   INVOCATION:
 *   sdsu_readSignal (sigNumber)
 *
 *   PARAMETERS: (">" input, "!" modified, "<" output)
 *   (>)   sigNumber      (int)   SDSU_ID for this controller
 *
 *   FUNCTION VALUE:
 *   None
 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Signal handler for readout task
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   The readout task is sent a SIGUSR1 signal by sdsu_frameSyncIsr. On receipt
 *   of this the sdsu_readSignal routine flags the current frame as complete.
 *   If there are further exposures to be read out, another frame is found, 
 *   passed to the VME DSP and queued for the image processing to work on.
 *
 *   NOTE:
 *   This code executes in the context of the task executing sdsu_readTask, 
 *   and therefore inherits that task's priority and task variables. This is 
 *   how sdsuReadContext is shared.
 *
 *   SEE ALSO:
 *   sdsu_readTask
 *   
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   (>)   sdsuReadContext    (SDSU_ID)   task variable holding SDSU context
 *
 *   INCLUDE FILES:
 *   sdsuLib.h
 *   errorLib.h
 *
 *   DEFICIENCIES:
 *   It is possible for the execution of the signal handler to be blocked if 
 *   the CPU is busy executing a packet or frame callback at the time when a 
 *   frame sync interrupt happens. Unfortunately, setting task priorities does 
 *   not solve this problem since the signal handler inherits the same priority
 *   as the readout task.
 *
 *   If an error occurs in the signal handler it is difficult for the detector 
 *   control task to discover that anything has gone wrong.

 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Download a list of parameter values from a file to an SDSU DSP
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine reads as ASCII file containing a list of parameters
 *   and values of the form
 *
 *      Param1 name   =>   Param1 value
 *      Param2 name   =>   Param2 value
 *      etc...        =>   etc...
 *
 *   The file can begin with a comment block containing a ";" in column 1.
 *   The parameter names and values are separated by white space. Each 
 *   name/value pair is terminated by a newline. The parameters are directed 
 *   to the DSP specified by destId, which can take one of the values specified
 *   in the table below.

 *      SDSU_IDENT_TIM   =>   Refers to Timing DSP
 *      SDSU_IDENT_UTL   =>   Refers to Utility DSP
 *
 *   If the DSP is determined from the parameter name, the first two characters
 *   of the each parameter name are used according to the this table.
 *
 *      V_   =>   Refers to VME DSP
 *      T_   =>   Refers to Timing DSP
 *      U_   =>   Refers to Utility DSP
 *
 *   This allows parameters to be downloaded from one file and directed to the
 *   appropriate DSPs.
 *
 *   NOTE:
 *   Parameters are set in the order they are found in the file. Parameters may
 *   not be set "on-the-fly" by downloading them from a file. 
 *
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   None
 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   None
 *
 *   REFERENCES:
 *   A list and description of the SDSU parameters may be found in ICD 1.6/1.10.
 *
 *   INCLUDE FILES:
 *   sdsuLib.h
 *   errorLib.h
 *
 *   DEFICIENCIES:
 *   The function is not very flexible when it comes to parsing the parameter 
 *   file. Comments can only occur at the beginning of the file and have to 
 *   have a ";" in column 1. In-line comments are not currently supported. 
 *   The remainder of the file after the comment block is assumed to consist 
 *   of parameter name/value pairs only.
 *
 *   At present, files uploaded using this sdsuParamUpload cannot be downloaded
 *   without first editing the parameter file. Allowing in-line comments 
 *   beginning with a ";" will solve this deficiency.
