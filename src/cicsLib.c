*
*   HISTORY
*   -------
*   04-Dec-1996: Original version with just cicsLogMessage,
*                cicsLogLong and cicsLogString, based on Michelle
*                logging library (which did not conform to the
*                Gemini SPS).                                        (smb)
*   16-Dec-1996: cicsLogFloat added.                                 (smb)
*   10-Jan-1997: cicsLogDouble added.                                (smb)
*   15-Jan-1997: A means of setting and testing the debug level
*                added. Fixed some syntax and formatting problems
*                noticed by Janet Tvedt.                             (smb)
*   16-Jan-1997: Functions renamed to conform to new Gemini SPS.     (smb)
*   23-Jan-1997: Removed the "static" storage class specifier on
*                the various message string buffers. This was
*                causing messages generated simultaneously by
*                different parallel processes to be overwritten.
*                Use MAX_STRING_SIZE instead of hard-wired size for
*                log message.                                        (smb)
*   27-Jan-1997: Modified cicsLogMessage to use a ring buffer of
*                messages to get around a deficiency of logMsg().    (smb)
*   04-Jun-1997: Size of message buffer increased from 40 to 64.     (smb)
*   17-Jun-1997: Modified to use a semaphore to ensure that two
*                tasks do not attempt to use the same element of
*                the message buffer at the same time.                (smb)
*   17-Jun-1997: Set top level prefixes. Janet Tvedt's database
*                access functions added.                             (smb,tvedt)
*   26-Jun-1997: Channel Access get and put functions added, but
*                then transferred to "cicsLib2.c" because it was
*                not possible to include "dbAccess.h" and
*                "cadefs.h" in the same file..                       (smb)
*   12-Aug-1997: Added check functions used by CAD functions.        (smb)
*   06-Jul-1998: Database access functions extracted and modified
*                for use with AGWPS.                                 (smb)

 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Function to get a value from an EPICS field by database access.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This routine is called to obtain the value of the specified field 
 * within an EPICS database record.  It handles potential errors by
 * sending messages to the CICS logging functions and returning an
 * error emssage and status value to the calling routine.
 *

 * dbGetField      - EPICS database access routine for retrieving the data
 *
 * PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 * None.
 * 
 * DEFICIENCIES:
 * I am informed (by Bret Goodrich) that the routine "recGblGetLinkValue" is
 * preferred to "dbGetField" by the EPICS community (because it can choose 
 * whether to use Channel Access or Database Access according to circumstances),
 * but "recGblGetLinkValue" is much more complicated, and I don't understand
 * its description in the "EPICS IOC Application Developers Guide".
 *
 * I am now informed (by Andy Foster several months later) that 
 * "recGblGetLinkValue" is only usuable as part of EPICS record support, and 
 * that the Channel Access function "ca_array_get" is the advertised public 
 * interface to EPICS.
