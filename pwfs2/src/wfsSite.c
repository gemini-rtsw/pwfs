 *	MODULE NAME:
 *	wfsSite
 *
 *	FILENAME:
 *	wfsSite.c
 *
 *	PURPOSE:
 *	Wavefront sensing site defintion - GEMINI NORTH VERSION.
 *
 *	DESCRIPTION:
 *	This module initialises the data structure which contains a definition of the CPU
 *	configuration at the current site, consisting of
 *	- the VxWorks target name for the processor;
 *	- the target architecture (TARGET_TYPE_MV167 or TARGET_TYPE_HKBAJA47);
 *	- the ethernet address (defined using an IPADDR_TO_HEX(a,b,d,c) macro);
 *	- the processor clock speed in Hz;
 *	- the amount of local RAM in bytes; and
 *	- a collection of flags describing the behaviour of the VME interface.
 *	which MUST be defined correctly for each site before the wavefront
 *	sensing system will function.
 *
 *	The data structure is initialised in wfsSite.c rather than wfsSite.h because of
 *	the programming convention that header files only declare objects and do
 *	not allocate memory space.
 *
 *	THIS FILE IS NOT RELEVANT AS LONG AS MPPIPEDRV AND SYSEXTLIB ARE NOT BEING USED.
 *
 *	FUNCTION NAME(S):
 *	None
 *
 *	NOTES:
 *	In its present form there needs to be a separate copy of this module
 *	for each site at which the AGWPS software will run, which leads to the
 *	risk that the various copies of this library will diverge. Can this sort of
 *	information not be downloaded from a file or defined from a function call at
 *	boot time?    SMB - 26 Nov 97.
 *
 *	The definitions in this file must be modified to reflect the
 *	actual cpu configuration at your site. See definitions below.
 *
 *	THIS FILE IS ONLY USED WHEN THE MULTI-PROCESSOR PIPE DRIVER AND
 *	SYSEXTLIB ARE BEING USED. OTHERWISE ITS CONTENTS ARE IGNORED.
