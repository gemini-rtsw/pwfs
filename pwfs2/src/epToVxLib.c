 *   MODULE NAME:
 *   epToVxLib
 *
 *   FILENAME:
 *   epToVxLib.c
 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   EPICS to VxWorks interface library
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   The epToVxLib library provides a pipe-based interface between an EPICS
 *   database running on one CPU and VxWorks tasks running on that and other
 *   CPUs which share the same VME bus. A central EPICS database resides on
 *   a nominated CPU in the system. Only the nominated CPU is required to
 *   support EPICS. The other CPUs only require VxWorks support.
 *
 *   The epToVxLib library uses the multi-processor pipe driver, mpPipeDrv,
 *   for communication between CPUs, and the standard VxWorks pipe driver,
 *   pipeDrv, for communication on the same CPU. Many of the epToVxLib
 *   functions allow the pipe driver to be chosen by providing a pointer
 *   to the appropriate "pipeCreate" function.
 *
 *   It is assumed that a description of the EPICS records known by the
 *   system is contained in array externals pWfsDbCadList, pWfsDbCarList and pWfsDbSirList,
 *   which are defined in wfsDb.h and wfsDb.c
 *

 *
 *   DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
 *   There are a number of potential deadlock scenarios caused by the way in
 *   which errors and messages are reported. If the EPICS database is used
 *   to maintain an error count (as is done in the Gemini A&G Wavefront
 *   Processing System) then problems may occur if any of the daemon tasks
 *   in this library attempt to report an error or a message. The deadlocks
 *   are avoided explicitly, as described in the comments for
 *   epToVxCaWriteDaemon and epToVxCarDaemon.
 *
 *   Many of the functions for dealing with CAD input and output attributes
 *   assume that the values of these attributes are character strings exactly
 *   EPICS_MAX_BYTES_STRING_ATTRIB in size and occupy consecutive slots
 *   in the cadRecord data structure. The functions will fail if any changes
 *   to EPICS render this assumption no longer valid.
 *
 *   I think this library is a lot more complicated than it needs to be. This
 *   library has suffered a lot from memory corruption bugs, caused by the fact
 *   that memory is allocated dynamically in several places, pointers are heavily
 *   used and arithmetic and type conversion are frequently carried out on pointers.
 *   In the long term I think this library should be replaced by something based
 *   around EPICS device support, and the pipe-based method of communicating database
 *   information should be replaced by a simpler shared memory technique.
 *   SMB - 1 July 1998.
 *
 *   BUGS:
 *   The Channel Access ID structures for EPICS SIR records can get corrupted,
 *   and I have found this happens most frequently when this library is used
 *   with the DEBUG compiler flag defined. I have spent several months debugging
 *   this library but have not yet managed to track this problem down. I suspect
 *   it is related to the memory corruption bugs I have been seeing (as described
 *   in the "BUGS" section of epToVxCaWrite and epToVxCaWriteDaemon).
 *
 *   The memory corruption has been found to be entirely within the channel access
 *   data structures. I have worked around it by commenting out the calls to channel
 *   access in epToVxCaWriteDaemon and epToVxCarDaemon and replacing them with
 *   database access calls.

 *   INVOCATION:
 *   epToVxCaInit (recordType, pRecordName, pCaDef)
 *
 *   PARAMETERS: (">" input, "!" modified, "<" output)
 *   (>)   recordType   (const int)      EPICS record type identifier
 *   (>)   pRecordName   (const char *)   name of record to initialise
 *   (!)   pCaDef      (CA_DEF)      channel-access definition structure to initialise
 *
 *   FUNCTION VALUE:
 *   (STATUS)  OK, or ERROR if initialisation failed
 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Initialise a record to enable channel access to it
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine initialises the structure pCaDef such that the structure
 *   can be used subsequently as a handle to the record for channel-
 *   access to it. The routine is used internally by epToVxLib and, in
 *   many applications, will not be called directly.
 *
 *   SUPPORT FOR THIS ROUTINE:
 *   This routine makes use of one or more EPICS libraries and can
 *   therefore only be used on a CPU which can call those EPICS libraries.
 *
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   (>)   pppWfsDbRecFieldName   (char ***)   array of record field names
 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   None
 *
 *   INCLUDE FILES:
 *   epToVxLib.h
 *
 *   DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
 *   The field type is stored twice, once in the channel access ID (chid) structure and
 *   and again  in the channel access definition structure. It would be safer and more
 *   efficient if this duplication could be removed.
 *   SMB - 16 Mar 1998.
 *
 *   There is a race condition in which it is possible for this function
 *   to crash with an error message, but the crash itself prevents the
 *   error logging task from running and displaying the error message.
 *   All error messages are duplicated through "printErr" statements
 *   to ensure they appear at the console.

 *   Do a channel-access write to an EPICS record
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine calls the channel access library routines ca_array_put()
 *   and ca_flush_io() to write to a named EPICS record. The pCaContext pointer
 *   is assumed to point to a valid CA_DEF structure and this is used to extract

 *
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   None
 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   The pCaContext structure must have been initialised via
 *   a previous call to an appropriate record-initialisation routine, e.g.
 *   epToVxCaInitCar or epToVxCaInitSir in the case of CAR or SIR records

 *   INCLUDE FILES:

 *
 *   DEFICIENCIES:
 *   None known
 *
 *   BUGS:
 *   There is an intermittent bug in this function which generates an access
 *   fault in the EPICS function dbPutfield(), which is called from ca_array_put().
 *   I think this may be a symptom of a memory corruption.
 *   SMB - 27 Jan 1998.
 *
 *   I have also seen "Channel access array put failed" errors being generated

 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Daemon task services channel-access writes via the pipe interface
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine is executed as a daemon task on the CPU which holds the
 *   EPICS database in what is, in general, a multi-CPU environment. The
 *   task creates, opens and then assignes one pipe to each CPU on VME bus
 *   and copies data packets arriving from any of these pipes to a destination

 *   data packets to the relevant pipe on a target CPU.
 *
 *   ERROR HANDLING:
 *   This routine will return ERROR if an error occurs during the initialisation
 *   phase. However once it starts processing response packets any errors will be
 *   logged but the routine will try to keep running. Any errors are logged
 *   immediately via the error-logging library, errorLib.

 *
 *   BUGS:
 *   This task was using global variables pWfsDbSirList and ppEpToVxCaDefTable without
 *   protecting any of them with a semaphore.
 *   SMB - 23 Mar 1998.
 *
 *   I have worked around some of the memory corruption bugs by using database access
 *   when Channel Access fails. This is only a fudge. The way this library uses EPICS
 *   facilities needs reviewing. SMB - 7 July 1998.
 *
 *   Andy Foster has suggested that he could fix the channel access memory corruption
 *   problems seen here. SMB - 8 Oct 1998.
 *
 *   The bugs in this task have now been avoided by using the CICS database access
 *   functions instead of Channel Access.

 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Initialisation routine for CAD record
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This is the initialisation routine for a CAD record. It is called when the
 *   record is initialised - normally when the IOC is initialised via iocInit().
 *   The routine is generic and re-entrant so that the same initialisation routine
 *   is used for all CAD records. Each CAD record has between one and two pipes
 *   associated with it: a "command pipe" always exists between the CAD record and
 *   a VxWorks task (the "control task", which is responsible for acting on
 *   each CAD command). A second pipe exists between the CAD record and
 *   the CAR daemon task epToVxCarDaemon(). This second pipe is used to
 *   set the CAR associated with a given CAD to the BUSY state on receipt of a
 *   CAD START directive. Neither of these two pipes is created by this routine.
 *
 *   ERROR HANDLING:
 *   Any errors are logged immediately via the error-logging library, errorLib.
 *
 *   SUPPORT FOR THIS ROUTINE:
 *   This routine makes use of one or more EPICS libraries and can
 *   therefore only be used on a CPU which can call those EPICS libraries.

 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   None
 *
 *   INCLUDE FILES:
 *   dbTypes.h
 *   epToVxLib.h
 *
 *   DEFICIENCIES:
 *   This routine extracts the definition of a CAD record from the local database
 *   (stored in the symbol table epToVxSymtab). This definition includes the type
 *   of each CAD attribute - LONG, DOUBLE or STRING (char *). The routine does not
 *   attempt to check that these type definitions correspond to those in the CAD
 *   fields pcad->ftva, pcad->ftvb through to pcad->ftvt. Such a check is clearly
 *   possible; its inclusion is left as an exercise for enthusiastic future users
 *   of epToVxLib.
 *
 *   This function assumes that the "cadRecord" data structure reserves a contiguous
 *   area of memory for attributes "a", "b", "c", etc... If the "cadRecord" structure
 *   changes so this is no longer true the function will no longer work.

 *   Execution routine for CAD record
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This is the execution routine for a CAD record. It is called whenever
 *   a CAD record receives a valid directive (e.g. MARK, PRESET, START etc).
 *   The routine is generic and re-entrant so that the same execution routine
 *   can be used for most CAD records. The CAD-specific operations are determined
 *   from the local definition of the record contained in the array external
 *   pWfsDbCadList[]. The following action is taken on receipt of each directive.
 *
 *      MARK    =>   No action taken. Always returns CAD_ACCEPT.
 *
 *      CLEAR   =>   Copy the default attribute values (defined in the
 *               declaration & initialisation of pWfsDbCadList[]) to the CAD's
 *               attribute inputs. Always returns CAD_ACCEPT.
 *
 *      PRESET   =>   Open pipe(s) between the CAD record and the associated
 *               control task and the CAR daemon task if these are not
 *               already open. Return CAD_REJECT if either pipe fails
 *               to open.
 *
 *      "      =>   Copy CAD attributes to local (static) storage and
 *               check each attribute value against any defined limits
 *               (given in the declaration & initialisation of pWfsDbCadList[]).
 *               Return CAD_REJECT if one or more attribute is out of
 *               range.
 *
 *      "      =>   Test whether the pipe used to write the CAD command
 *               and its attributes has an empty message slot. If the
 *               pipe is full, return CAD_REJECT otherwise CAD_ACCEPT.
 *
 *      START   =>   Write a "START" command to the pipe(s) associated with this
 *               CAD record. Always returns CAD_ACCEPT.
 *
 *      STOP   =>   If the STOP directive is not supported (as defined in
 *               the declaration & initialisation of pWfsDbCadList[]), return
 *               CAD_REJECT. If STOP is supported, write a "STOP" command
 *               to the pipe(s) associated with the CAD record. Always returns
 *               CAD_ACCEPT.
 *
 *   As shown in the table, the START and STOP CAD directives cause "START" and
 *   "STOP" commands to be written to the pipe(s) associated with each CAD record.
 *   The commands consist of data structures which are written to the pipe(s) as
 *   atomic operations - each data structure generally consists of a command header
 *   and, in the case of a START directive, additional elements containing CAD
 *   attributes converted from strings to their native types. The command header
 *   contains information such as the CAD directive, the simulation mode, the
 *   client ID and details of any attributes which follow. Any attributes that
 *   match the defined default value are not written as part of a command packet
 *   but are inserted at the receiving task. In the event that the CAD record is
 *   responsible for setting the associated CAR BUSY on receipt of a START,
 *   directive only the command header is written to the CAR daemon.
 *
 *   ERROR HANDLING:
 *   Any errors are logged immediately via the error-logging library, errorLib.
 *
 *   SUPPORT FOR THIS ROUTINE:
 *   This routine makes use of one or more EPICS libraries and can
 *   therefore only be used on a CPU which can call those EPICS libraries.
 *
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   (>)   epToVxSymtab         (SYMTAB_ID)      symbol table used internally by epToVxLib
 *   (!)   epToVxCadSimMode      (int)         CAD simulation mode
 *   (>)   pWfsDbRecInitialised   (BOOL *)      array of record-initialisation-done flags

 *                                    from the epToVxSymtab symbol table and therefore
 *                                    a globally accessible data structure.
 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   The symbol table and data structures should have been initialised with
 *   epToVxCadInit.
 *
 *   INCLUDE FILES:
 *   dbTypes.h
 *   epToVxLib.h
 *
 *   DEFICIENCIES:
 *   Because this is a general purpose routine designed to be used with any CAD
 *   command, it is hard for the CAD record to make other than simple range
 *   checks on its inputs. For example, it would be useful if a CAD had the
 *   ability to reject a command if, say, attribute B was smaller than A.
 *   SMB - 2 Feb 1998.
 *
 *   DESIGN FLAWS:
 *   The CAR record corresponding to a command should not go BUSY when a STOP
 *   directive is received. The STOP directive is supposed to stop the action
 *   started by the START directive and make the CAR record go IDLE. The
 *   protocol between the CAD record and CAR daemon needs redesigning.
 *   SMB - 20 Feb 1998.

 *   FUNCTION NAME:
 *   epToVxCadCopy
 *
 *   INVOCATION:
 *   epToVxCadCopy (pcad)
 *
 *   PARAMETERS: (">" input, "!" modified, "<" output)
 *   (>)   cadRecord   (struct cadRecord *)   pointer to CAD record structure
 *
 *   FUNCTION VALUE:
 *   (long)   CAD_ACCEPT or CAD_REJECT depending on whether the directive was
 *   accepted or rejected
 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Execution routine for CAD record which simply copies its inputs to its outputs
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This is the execution routine for a CAD record representing a command implemented
 *   purely using EPICS database records. It will do nothing except copy the input
 *   attributes; A, B, C etc... to its outputs; VALA, VALB, VALC etc... It will not
 *   check the attributes for validity. If such a validity check is required, then an
 *   application should supply its own version of this function. A CAD record
 *   which uses this function does not need to be declared in the array of
 *   pWfsDbCadList[] structures. The following action is taken on receipt of each
 *   directive.
 *
 *      MARK    =>   No action taken. Always returns CAD_ACCEPT.
 *
 *      CLEAR   =>   No action taken. Always returns CAD_ACCEPT.
 *
 *      PRESET   =>   Copies inputs to outputs. Returns CAD_ACCEPT if successful.
 *
 *      START   =>   No action taken. Always returns CAD_ACCEPT.
 *
 *      STOP   =>   Cannot be stopped. Always returns CAD_REJECT.
 *
 *   It is assumed the response through a CAR record will be handled elsewhere.
 *
 *   ERROR HANDLING:
 *   Any errors are logged immediately via the error-logging library, errorLib.
 *
 *   SUPPORT FOR THIS ROUTINE:
 *   This routine makes use of one or more EPICS libraries and can
 *   therefore only be used on a CPU which can call those EPICS libraries.
 *
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   None
 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   None
 *
 *   INCLUDE FILES:
 *   epToVxLib.h
 *
 *   DEFICIENCIES:
 *   None known

 *   This is the execution routine for a CAD record representing an unsupported

 *   which uses this function does not need to be declared in the array of
 *   pWfsDbCadList[] structures. The following action is taken on receipt of each
 *   directive.
 *
 *      MARK    =>   No action taken. Always returns CAD_ACCEPT.
 *
 *      CLEAR   =>   No action taken. Always returns CAD_ACCEPT.
 *
 *      PRESET   =>   Always returns CAD_REJECT.
 *
 *      START   =>   Always returns CAD_REJECT.
 *
 *      STOP   =>   Always returns CAD_REJECT.
 *
 *   Because no action is ever started by an unsupported command, there is no
 *   response through a CAR record.
 *
 *   ERROR HANDLING:
 *   Any errors are logged immediately via the error-logging library, errorLib.

 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Daemon task maintains an EPICS CAR record
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine executes as a daemon task which is responsible for maintaining
 *   the status of an EPICS CAR record. It executes on the CPU which holds the
 *   EPICS database in which the CAR resides and a separate daemon must be spawned
 *   for each CAR. This CAR daemon task creates and opens a pipe to which each CAD
 *   record associated with the CAR record can write command-header packets during 
 *   its execution routine (see epToVxCadExecute()). The "command-header" packets
 *   contain the header associated with a CAD command. The CAR daemon also opens a
 *   "response" pipe via which the response of VxWorks control tasks to CAD commmands
 *   are received in the form of "response" data packets. These command-header and
 *   response packets determine the states through which the CAR record is driven.
 *
 *   SIMULATION MODES:
 *   The CAR daemon supports the VSM simulation mode as follows. If a command header
 *   is received with VSM simulation mode enabled, then the daemon will set the CAR
 *   to the "BUSY" and then "IDLE" states, simulating the CAD/CAR interface without
 *   involving any other application tasks.
 *
 *   ERROR HANDLING:
 *   This routine will return ERROR if an error occurs during the initialisation
 *   phase. However once it starts processing response packets any errors will be
 *   logged but the routine will try to keep running. Any errors are logged
 *   immediately via the error-logging library, errorLib.
 *
 *   SUPPORT FOR THIS ROUTINE:
 *   This routine makes use of one or more EPICS libraries and can
 *   therefore only be used on a CPU which can call those EPICS libraries.
 *
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   (>)   epToVxSymtab   (SYMTAB_ID)         symbol table used internally by epToVxLib

 *                                 from the epToVxSymtab symbol table and therefore
 *                                 a pointer to a globally accessible data structure.
 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   None
 *
 *   INCLUDE FILES:
 *   epToVxLib.h
 *
 *   DEFICIENCIES:
 *   Only a limited amount of information can be exchanged between command
 *   tasks and the CAR daemon due to the fixed size of the command packets.
 *
 *   BUGS:
 *   The same memory corruption bugs in the Channel Access ID structures described
 *   in epToVxCaWriteDaemon are seen in this function also. The same bug work around
 *   has been applied. SMB - 7 Jul 1998. This bug has been avoided by using the
 *   CICS database access functions instead of Channel Access. SMB - 27 Jan 1999.
 *
 *   If an error occurs during the initialisation of this function, the memory allocated
 *   by this function is not freed. This will lead to a memory leak if the initialisation
 *   of the function is repeated. SMB - 8 Oct 1998.
 *
 *   DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
 *   Memory is allocated for the command packets but never freed. This is
 *   acceptable because the daemon task is expected to loop forever.
 *
 *   When a command fails the daemon task writes the message "Command failed" to
 *   the CAR record. I find this message unhelpful, and it would be better if
 *   the actual error message reported by the command task could be written.
 *   Doing this would involve increasing the size of the command done packet.
 *
 *   This function does not distinguish between START and STOP directives, and
 *   it will therefore assume that a STOP directive will result in the same changes
 *   to the CAR record as a START directive (i.e. BUSY then IDLE).

 *
 *   PARAMETERS: (">" input, "!" modified, "<" output)
 *   None
 *
 *   FUNCTION VALUE:
 *   (STATUS)   OK, or ERROR if initialisation failed
 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Initialise genSub records in the local database
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine initialises the local database (epToVxSymtab) with
 *   information about genSub records such that those genSub
 *   records listed in the array pWfsDbGsubList[] may be accessed via epToVxLib.
 *
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   (!)   epToVxSymtab         (SYMTAB_ID)      symbol table used internally by epToVxLib
 *   (>) pWfsDbGsubList         (CAD_RECORD *)   array defining the system's genSub records
 *   (>)   wfsDbNGsubRecord      (int)         number of genSUb records known to the system
 *   (!)   pWfsDbRecInitialised   (BOOL *)      array of record-initialisation-done flags
 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   A list of genSub records should already have been defined in the pWfsDbGsubList[] data
 *   structures.
 *
 *   INCLUDE FILES:
 *   dbTypes.h
 *   epToVxLib.h
 *   wfsDb.h
 *
 *   DEFICIENCIES:
 *   There is a race condition in which it is possible for this function
 *   to crash with an error message, but the crash itself prevents the
 *   error logging task from running and displaying the error message.
 *   All error messages are duplicated through "printErr" statements
 *   to ensure they appear at the console.

 *   (STATUS)   OK, or ERROR if the record has not been initialised or if

 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   Write to EPICS data record via the pipe-based interface
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This routine writes data to an EPICS record via the pipe-based interface
 *   to the record, and using the daemon task (see epToVxCaWriteDaemon()) which
 *   is responsible for maintaining all such records. A typical example of a
 *   "data record" is a SIR, to which a single value of type long, double or
 *   char* may be written. However the routine will support arbitrary data types
 *   (including arrays) providing an initialisation routine is provided
 *   for the record type and that the daemon task epToVxCaWriteDaemon() supports
 *   the record. The parameter pValue is points to the first element of data to
 *   write to the record and may, in general, point to an array of whatever type
 *   is relevant for the named record.
 *
 *   The record to write may be identified in one of two ways. Firstly, if pRecordName
 *   is non-NULL, then it points to a string containing the EPICS record name.
 *   In this case the name string may be either the full record name - including the
 *   name-prefix given by the macro TOP - or alternatively the name prefix may be
 *   omitted. e.g. A record with the full name "system:recName" and with the macro
 *   TOP defined as "system:", may be accessed with either of *pRecordName="system:recName"
 *   or *pRecordName="recName". In this mode the parameter pContextKnown should be NULL.
 *
 *   The second way of identifying the record to write is via its context
 *   structure, pContextKnown. If this is non-NULL (and pRecordName is NULL), then
 *   pContextKnown is assumed to have been obtained previously via a call to
 *   epToVxRecContextGet(). This mode is provided to avoid the overhead of looking-up
 *   a record's context structure on successive calls to this routine in applications
 *   in which a task is devoted to maintaining an EPICS record via repeated calls to
 *   this routine.
 *
 *   HYSTERESIS ON RECORD UPDATES:
 *   Each data record has an associated hysteresis value. This determines the
 *   minimum change in the record value (for single-valued records only) that
 *   will trigger an update to the record. This feature allows the data traffic
 *   associated with record updates to be minimised in applications in which
 *   a record may potentially be updated by insignificant amounts at a relatively
 *   high rate. In multi-CPU applications, each record update requires a VME
 *   data transfer and it may then be desirable to limit the data traffic in
 *   this way.
 *
 *   DATA FILTERING OPTION:
 *   Each data record may be assigned a set of filter parameters which define
 *   a filter to be applied to the data values that are passed via this routine.
 *
 *   EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *   (>)   epToVxPipeWriteFd   (int)   file descriptor used to write to EPICS records
 *
 *   PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *   None
 *
 *   INCLUDE FILES:
 *   epToVxLib.h
 *
 *   DEFICIENCIES:
 *   The filtering option described above is not currently implemented.
 *
 *   This function can currently only be used to write to SIR records.
 *
 *   DEVELOPMENT NOTE:
 *   This function is often called with pValue pointing at a constant.
 *   The fact that filtering can cause this value to be updated needs to
 *   be reconsidered. SMB - 17 Mar 1998.

 *   This routine writes a new value to an EPICS health record. The name of

 *   health value, which should take one of the following values
 *
 *      GOOD   =>   The system is functioning normally.
 *      WARNING   =>   The system can still function, but there is a
 *               problem which may affect the system's performance.
 *      BAD      =>   A problem has rendered the system inoperable.
 *

 *   that error affects the health of a system.
 *

 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   This is the initialisation routine for a control task in the epToVxLib

 *   associated command-response packets to a CAR daemon task. The control task
 *   is a VxWorks task which handles the overall coordination of commands
 *   associated with a single CAR record; a control task may process commands
 *   from any number of CADs. The name of the control task, pTaskName, forms
 *   the basis of the command and response pipes and must agree with the task
 *   name given in the definition of the relevant CAD/CAR records in the
 *   declaration of the array pWfsDbCadList[]. The pipe names used are
 *v
 *v      Command pipe name   =   "/pipe/taskName_CadToTask"
 *v      Response pipe name   =   "/pipe/taskName_TaskToCar"
 *v
 *   where "taskName" is the string pointed to by pTaskName. If pTaskName is NULL,
 *   this routine determines the name of the parent task (via taskLib) and adopts
 *   this as "taskName".
