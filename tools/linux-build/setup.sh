# applSetup OVERWRITES the application's own startup files from the site
# templates. In an existing startup directory it copies, unconditionally:
#
#   templates/uae/startup/local<SITE>.vws  -> startup/local.vws
#   templates/uae/startup/resource<SITE>.def -> startup/resource.def
#   templates/uae/startup/UAE.dist         -> startup/UAE.dist
#
# (GEM7 applSetup.pl lines 571 and 592; GEM8.4 is the same when APPLIC_SITE is
# set, which it always is here.) So a customised local.vws is silently
# reverted to the template on every build -- and because the template is a
# plausible-looking site file, the result boots and mounts from the WRONG file
# server rather than failing. That is exactly how this bit hrwfs: its
# local.vws had been re-homed to mkotcsbootv2-lv1 and every RPM shipped the
# template's pisces-control instead.
#
# Evidence this has bitten people before: pwfs1's SVN tree still carries
# startup/local.vws_BACKUP and startup/resource.def_BACKUP.
#
# So: stash whatever the repository actually versions, and put it back after.
# Only files that existed BEFORE are restored -- if a file legitimately comes
# from the template, it is not in the stash and is left alone.

#
# The top-level Makefile is on the list for the same reason: applSetup
# replaces it with the UAE template, whose first line is a bare
# `include .applTop`. That silently deleted the rule that lets plain `make`
# bootstrap a fresh checkout -- setup.sh, triggered BY that rule, removed it.
