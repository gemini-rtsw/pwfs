# Linux equivalent of polaris' GEM8.4 environment, in sh syntax.
# Source this before `gmake`: HOST_ARCH in particular must be in the
# environment, or the build resolves CONFIG_HOST_ARCH.unsupported and stops.
#
# The RPM-installed gem-epics3134gem84 package ships the same values as
# /etc/profile.d/gem84.sh; this copy is for a tree mounted at the Solaris
# paths. Note pwfs builds against GEM8.4 -- not hrwfs's GEM7, and not
# gmoscc's GEM8.6.
