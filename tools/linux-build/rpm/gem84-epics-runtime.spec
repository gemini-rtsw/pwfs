# EPICS 3.13.4 GEM8.4 *target* binaries at the path the crates load them from.
#
# Not to be confused with gem-epics3134gem84, which installs the BUILD tree
# under /usr/software/dev/packages/epics/... -- host tools, UAE config, rules,
# and the prebuilt ppc604 record objects gemini.Support is assembled from.
# That one is what gmake needs. This one is what the IOC needs: at boot both
# PWFS crates do
#
#   ld < /gemini/external/GEM8.4/base/bin/ppc604/iocCore
#   ld < /gemini/external/GEM8.4/base/bin/ppc604/seq
#   ld < /gemini/external/GEM8.4/extensions/bin/ppc604/pvload
#
# and nothing packaged them. They exist on the file server only because it is
# a copy of an older export, so a clean install of pwfs and its other
# dependencies would produce a crate that mounts /gemini, cd's correctly, and
# then dies on the first ld. Same gap gem7-epics-runtime closed for hrwfs and
# gem86-epics-runtime for GMOS.

%description
The EPICS 3.13.4 GEM8.4 base and extensions ppc604 binaries (iocCore, seq,
pvload and companions) at /gemini/external/GEM8.4, the path vxWorks IOCs load
them from over NFS. Host-side build tooling is in gem-epics3134gem84.
