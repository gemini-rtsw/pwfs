# Build the EPICS 3.13.4GEM8.4 host tools for HOST_ARCH=Linux.
#
# These are NATIVE Linux binaries built with the system gcc -- no cross
# compiler involved. They are what the UAE build needs before it can do
# anything: dbExpand (expands the dbd), macTest (generates the vxWorks startup
# scripts from *.vws), snc (sequencer), antelope/e_flex (the yacc/lex the
# others are built from), dbToRecordtypeH, sf2db.
#
# Runs inside gem-builder-hrwfs:el9 with the writable tree bind-mounted at
# /usr/software -- the config files carry absolute paths, so the tree has to
# live where Solaris had it.

# --- 32-bit host tools -------------------------------------------------
# EPICS 3.13.4 is 1990s code that assumes a 32-bit host. Built x86-64, the
# dbStatic parser silently drops field attributes: dbExpand emits a database
# with no asl() or extra() declarations at all and exits 0. The Solaris tools
# are 32-bit SPARC, so 32-bit is the faithful choice.
#
# Passed as WRAPPER SCRIPTS rather than 'ACC=gcc -m32', for two reasons:
# a make command-line assignment is one word (an embedded space makes make
# read -m32 as an option), and a command-line assignment also overrides
# in-makefile '+=' appends -- setting USR_LDFLAGS=-m32 silently wiped the
# -L paths that CONFIG.Host.UnixCommon appends, so every link failed with
# "cannot find -lDb -lCom".
