 *	MODULE NAME:
 *	mpPipeDrv
 *
 *	FILENAME:
 *	mpPipeDrv.c
 *
 *	DESCRIPTION:
 *	Multi-processor pipe device driver for VxWorks, used for
 *	inter-processor pipe communications over VME bus. This driver
 *	provides support for pipe devices on multiple VxWorks CPUs
 *	which share the same VME bus
 *
 *	The multi-processor pipe driver, mpPipeDrv, relies on the extended systems library,
 *	sysextLib, for the underlying VME bus communications used by the driver.
 *
 *	mpPipeDrv is, by default, installed as a VxWorks device driver and in this case
 *	the standard driver routines (create, open, close, read, write and ioctl) are
 *	only accessible via the I/O system. An option is provided to compile
 *	the driver as a VxWorks library which allows the driver routines to be
 *	available in the public interface (as mpPipeDevCreate, mpPipeOpen, mpPipeClose,
 *	mpPipeRead, mpPipeWrite and mpPipeIoctl). This option is intended to be used
 *	for debugging purposes only and is selected by defining the macro
 *	NO_INSTALL when mpPipeDrv.c is compiled
 *
 *	EXTERNAL MODULES:
 *	timeoutLib
 *	sysextLib
 *	errorLib
 *
 *	FUNCTION NAME(S):

 *
 *	DEFICIENCIES
 *	For some reason this library uses a mixture of vxWorks defined types (e.g. "UINT16")
 *	and Nick Dillon defined types (e.g. "uint32"). This might cause portability problems.
 *	SMB - 29 September 1998.
 *
 *	The idea behind this library is a really good one, but it fails to be portable
 *	because it uses sysextLib, which makes very specific assumptions about the underlying
 *	hardware, to handle the interprocessor communication. A new version of this library,
 *	based around VxMP shared message queues, would be a substantial improvement.
 *	SMB - 29 September 1998.

 *
 *	FUNCTION VALUE:
 *	(STATUS)  OK, or ERROR if the driver could not be initialised or installed
 *
 *	PURPOSE:
 *	Initialisation routine for multi-processor pipe driver
 *
 *	DESCRIPTION:
 *	The multi-processor pipe driver relies on the extended systems library,
 *	sysextLib, for the underlying VME bus communications used by the driver.
 *	This routine initialises the shared-memory data structures used by each
 *	processor for these communications. If the local processor number is zero -
 *	as determined by a previous call to sysextProcNumSet() - then the processor
 *	is adopted as the "Master" by the pipe driver system and it initialises all
 *	other "Slave" processors on the bus. Each Slave is initialised by first
 *	enabling its VME interface and then writing a heartbeat counter to
 *	its local mailbox registers. When the Master detects a slave's heartbeat it
 *	then waits for the Slave to read the address of a global data structure called
 *	the Master Control Structure, or MCS, which exists in a cache-safe area of the
 *	Master's local RAM. Each Slave reads the address of the MCS from the Master's
 *	Mailbox registers and then writes the address of a single character flag,
 *	called the Command flag (which is held in cache-safe RAM by each Slave) back to
 *	the Master's mailbox registers. When the Master processor has a uploaded Command
 *	Flag pointer from every Slave on the bus it writes an array of these pointers
 *	to the MCS and instructs each Slave in turn to upload the entire array. The
 *	Command flag pointers are subsequently used by each Slave to signal to another
 *	processor when a command is being issued to it. The MCS is used as a central
 *	location for the broadcasting of commands (e.g. create, delete, open etc) to
 *	every processor on the bus.
 *
 *	If a timeout occurs whilst processor #0 attempts to initialise any other
 *	processor on the bus, then if input parameter resetBusOnTimeout is TRUE
 *	an attempt is made to assert the VME bus sysrst* signal, thus resetting
 *	all processors on the bus. Note that not all target architectures allow
 *	sysrst* to be asserted from software control (see routine sysextBusReset in
 *	sysextLib for details of supported architectures). In the event that the
 *	architecture does not support VME bus resetting, a timeout on processor #0
 *	will simply return ERROR. The timeout period, in seconds, is set by input
 *	parameter timeoutSecs; a negative timeout period forces an infinite timeout
 *	period.
 *
 *	NO INSTALL option:
 *	mpPipeDrv is, by default installed as a VxWorks device driver and in this case
 *	the standard driver routines (create, open, close, read, write and ioctl) are
 *	only accessible via the I/O system. An option is however provided to compile
 *	the driver as a VxWorks library which allows the driver routines to be
 *	available in the public interface (as mpPipeDevCreate, mpPipeOpen, mpPipeClose,
 *	mpPipeRead, mpPipeWrite and mpPipeIoctl). This option is intended to be used
 *	for debugging purposes only and is selected by defining the macro
 *	NO_INSTALL when mpPipeDrv.c is compiled.
 *
 *	EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *	(!)	pCmdFlag		(volatile char *)	Local command flag, may be set by other CPUs
 *	(!)	ppRemoteCmdFlag	(volatile char **)	Array of command flag pointers
 *
 *	PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *	This routine is normally called immediately following a VME system reset.
 *	All processors on the bus should be initialised at the same time.
 *	The local processor's VME interface must have been intialised with
 *	a previous call to sysextProcNumSet(). VME block transfers must also have
 *	been initialised if they are to be used by the driver, e.g. the routine
 *	sysextVmeBlockInit() may be used to perform this initialisation. The real-time
 *	clock (CLOCK_REALTIME) must have been initialised with a call to clock_setres().
 *
 *	LIMITATIONS:
 *	The driver does not allow more than one processor to open a pipe in the same
 *	mode. This restricts multi-processor pipes to point-to-point connections
 *	between two processors on the bus at any instance in time. For example, an
 *	application which requries that three different processors write to a task running
 *	on a fourth processor must use three separate multi-processor pipes (one per
 *	writer); the fourth processor may then use the select library (selectLib) to
 *	effectively multiplex these three pipes into a single source of data.
 *
 *	DEFICIENCIES:
 *	None known

 *	PURPOSE:
 *	Create multi-processor pipe device
 *
 *	DESCRIPTION:
 *	This routine creates a multi-processor pipe device on all processors on
 *	VME bus, thus making the pipe available for subsequent opening, reading
 *	and writing by any processors on the bus. Created pipes are installed in
 *	the IO system device table via iosDevAdd(). The parameters associated with
 *	pipe creation are analogous to those of conventional pipes (see the manual
 *	entry for pipeDevCreate()), however there are two distinct types of
 *	multi-processor pipe, as follow:
 *
 *	BUFFERED PIPES:
 *	This is generally referred to as the "normal" mode for multi-processor
 *	pipes. A buffered pipe is created with the parameter nMessages (passed to
 *	mpPipeDevCreate()) greater than 0. In this case, VxWorks message queues
 *	are used at either end of the pipe to buffer data written into (or read
 *	from) the pipe. A buffered pipe therefore provides an almost identical
 *	interface as a conventional VxWorks pipe. One difference which should be
 *	recognised however is that, for multi-processor pipes, nMessages gives
 *	the number of stages of message queue buffering in EACH processor for a
 *	pipe connection which exists between two processors on VME bus. Furthermore,
 *	an additional stage of buffering occurs at the low-level VME interface so
 *	that the total number of stages of buffering between two processors for
 *	such a pipe is (2xN+1) where N is the parameter, nMessages, with which the
 *	pipe was created. It is legitimate to open a buffered multi-processor pipe
 *	for reading and writing by the same processor and in this case the
 *	number of stages of buffering is simply N (nMessages), as is the case for
 *	a conventional pipe.
 *
 *	USING MULTI-PROCESSOR PIPES IN CONJUNCTION WITH RAW VME-BUS TRANSFERS:
 *	Maximum throughput for VME bus data transfers is obtained with low-level
 *	VME block transfer operations which do not involve the VxWorks I/O system.
 *	For example, the library sysextLib provides routines sysextVmeBlockInit() and
 *	sysextVmeBlockCopy() which support raw block copies (D32/BLT or D64/BLT mode)
 *	from the local CPU to any address on the bus. The use of these routines
 *	to transfer data between two VxWorks CPUs will generally require some higher-
 *	level inter-processor communications because VxWorks allocates memory
 *	dynamically so that the destination CPU must notifiy the source CPU of the
 *	destination address (on VME bus) for the data transfer. In this case, multi-
 *	processor pipes provide the functionality required to support a simple
 *	protocol which will enable raw VME block transfers to be initiated.
 *	Furthermore, the library supports a special kind of pipe known as an
 *	"un-buffered" pipe. These pipes provide a simple wrapper around the routine
 *	sysextVmeBlockCopy() such that high VME throughput is achieved whilst the
 *	low-level protocol required to set-up and execute block transfers is hidden
 *	from application code. See the description below for more details of
 *	un-buffered pipes.
 *
 *	UN-BUFFERED PIPES:
 *	An unbuffered pipe is created by setting the parameter nMessages to
 *	zero when mpPipeDevCreate() is called. In this case, the input and
 *	output to multi-processor pipes are not buffered and an application
 *	program is required to read/write directly into an area of memory
 *	reserved by the driver when a pipe is created. This approach has two
 *	major advantages over buffered pipes. Firstly, memory usage is
 *	minimised (since memory is not allocated for internal message queues),
 *	and this can be important when transferring large blocks of data.
 *	Secondly, the overall throughput of the driver when transferring data
 *	between two tasks is increased by up to an order of magnitude
 *	since the overhead of copying data to and from the message queues is
 *	eliminated. A disadvantage of unbuffered pipes is that the external
 *	interface is slightly more complicated than that of buffered pipes (see
 *	below). Also, unbuffered pipes may NOT be opened for reading and
 *	writing by the same processor.
 *
 *	USING UN-BUFFERED PIPES:
 *	When an unbuffered pipe is opened, the driver allocates an area of
 *	memory - called the Local Buffer - which it uses for VME transfers
 *	to/from another processor. A pointer to the first available data
 *	byte within this area of memory may be obtained via ioctl() using
 *	the control function FIOFSTATGET (see manual entry for mpPipeIoctl()).
 *	A task which writes or reads an unbuffered pipe should therefore use
 *	ioctl() as an alternative to allocating memory explicitely for its
 *	input or output buffer, and this pointer passed to write() or read()
 *	when writing or reading from an unbuffered pipe. Note however, that
 *	write() and read() simply ignore the pointer actually passed to them
 *	when the pipe type is unbuffered. In view of the fact that application
 *	code makes direct access to the Local Buffer used by the driver, some
 *	form of synchronisation mechanism is necessary to ensure that these
 *	buffers are only accessed when it is safe to do so. This synchronisation
 *	is achieved using semaphores. A binary or counting semaphore (but not
 *	a mutex semaphore) may be associated with a pipe via either ioctl()
 *	or the alternative routine mpPipeIoctlByName() (see the respective
 *	manual page entries). If such an association has been made, then
 *	the driver will give the specified semaphore immediately following
 *	transfer of data from the Local Buffer to a destination on VME bus,
 *	or, immediately on receipt of data from VME bus into the Local Buffer.
 *	Since an unbuffered pipe may only be opened to either write OR read
 *	(but not both) by a single processor, the reason for the semaphore
 *	being given is always implicit in the mode in which the pipe is
 *	opened.
 *
 *	EXAMPLES OF BUFFERED AND UN-BUFFERED PIPES:
 *	Two examples of the usage of the multi-processor pipe driver are
 *	provided by routines mpDemo1() and mpDemo2(). The first
 *	of these ping-pongs a message between two different processors using
 *	buffered pipes. The second performs multiple transfers from
 *	one processor to a second using unbuffered pipes.
 *
 *	USING MULTI-PROCESSOR PIPES FOR INTER-PROCESSOR SYNCHRONISATION:
 *	A multi-processor pipe device may be used to provide synchronisation
 *	between two processors on VME bus. In this case the pipe may be created
 *	with parameter nBytes set to zero so that no information bytes are
 *	transferred when a message is written, however the communication protocol
 *	provides the synchronisation function. In this case a multi-processor
 *	pipe is analogous to a counting semaphore, with the semGive() and
 *	semTake() routines replaced by write() and read() respectively; note,
 *	however, that in this case the "semGive()" routine may potentially block
 *	if all stages of message queue buffering become full. It is also
 *	possible to specify a semaphore ID to be given whenever data is read
 *	(from VME bus) by the pipe daemon task. To do this, a task must first
 *	open the pipe and create the required type of semaphore (counting or
 *	binary, but NOT a mutex semaphore); the task then calls ioctl() with
 *	function = FIOSETOPTIONS and the argument equal to the required
 *	semaphore ID. The semGive() may be disabled by re-executing this
 *	ioctl() function with the semaphore ID set to NULL.
 *
 *	EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *	None
 *
 *	PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *	The pipe driver must have been previously initialised.

 *
 *	DESCRIPTION:
 *	This routine is normally called directly by the IO system (rather than
 *	by an application program) in response to a call to ioctl(). Its purpose
 *	is to perform an IO control function on a multi-processor pipe. The
 *	following IO control functions are supported by the driver:
 *
 *		FIOGETNAME		=>	Get name of pipe associated with fd. The name is
 *							copied to (char *) arg, which must therefore point to
 *							a buffer large enough to receive the information.
 *		FIONREAD		=>	Get number of bytes ready to read. Number is copied
 *							to (int *) arg.
 *		FIONMSGS		=>	If arg is zero on entry, get the number of messages
 *							in the local message queue. If arg is non-zero, get
 *							the number of empty message slots in the local queue.
 *							The number of messages, or emoty slots, is copied to
 *							(int *) arg.
 *		FIOFLUSH		=>	Flush out write path for pipe. The pipe must be
 *							opened to write by the issuing processor.
 *		FIOSETOPTIONS	=>	Set pipe options. Only one option is currently defined,
 *							this is an optional semaphore which may be given
 *							whenever a message packet is read from VME bus or
 *							written to VME bus. The semaphore type may be
 *							counting or binary, but a mutex semaphore may NOT be
 *							specified. The semaphore ID is passed via arg. A SEM_ID
 *							value of NULL disables the semGive(), and this is the
 *							default SEM_ID set when a pipe is first opened.
 *		FIOATTRIBSET	=>	Set pipe attributes. Only the "Pipe Invalid" attribute
 *							may be set and no arguments are therefore taken to this
 *							function. When marked as invalid, a pipe becomes
 *							unavailable for any further use. This is normally
 *							performed only internally by the driver in the event of
 *							an error and the function should be used only for
 *							debugging.
 *		FIOFSTATGET		=>	Get "file status" for pipe. The file status structure
 *							is defined in mpPipeDrv.h and contains the ID numbers
 *							of those processors to which the pipe is
 *							currently opened to read and write, as well as the
 *							validity status flag (which should normally be TRUE)
 *							and a pointer to the local buffer allocated for the
 *							driver.
 *		FIOSELECT		=>	This function is called only by the select library via
 *						 	the IO system.
 *		FIOUNSELECT	=>		This function is called only by the select library via
 *							the IO system.
 *
 *	The above function numbers (# defines) are defined in ioLib.h.
 *
 *	SPECIFYING A PIPE BY NAME RATHER THAN FILE DESCRIPTOR:
 *	In some circumstances it may be necessary to perform ioctl() functions on a
 *	pipe which has not been opened by the local processor. For example, whilst
 *	polling for a remote processor to open a pipe; in this case there is no local
 *	file descriptor assigned to the pipe so that ioctl() cannot be used. An
 *	alternative function, mpPipeIoctlByName(), is therefore provided to meet such
 *	requirements. mpPipeIoctlByName() is passed the name of a pipe, rather than a file
 *	descriptor, and may therefore be used immediately the pipe has been created.
 *	See the manual entry for mpPipeIoctl() for further details.
 *
 *	EXTERNAL VARIABLES:
 *	None
 *
 *	PRIOR REQUIREMENTS:
 *	This routine is only available globally if the pipe driver was compiled
 *	with the NO_INSTALL option flag defined. The pipe must have been previously

 *	and examines each to see whether incoming data has been writtten from

 *	unknown the daemon examines all known pipes to see whether outgoing data
 *	may be written by one of them to an external processor. This latter case
 *	arises, for example, when an external processor which was previously
 *	blocked for writing one a particular pipe (message queue full) un-blocks
 *	thus allowing this processor to de-queue any write requests that it may
 *	have previously queued.
