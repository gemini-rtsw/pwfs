 *   MODULE NAME:
 *   epToVxLib
 *
 *   FILENAME:
 *   epToVxLib.c
 *
 *   PURPOSE:
 *   EPICS to VxWorks interface library
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *   The epToVxLib library provides a pipe-based interface between an EPICS
 *   database running on one CPU and VxWorks tasks running on that and other
 *   CPUs which share the same VME bus. A central EPICS database resides on
 *   a nominated CPU in the system. Only the nominated CPU is required to
 *   support EPICS. The other CPUs only require VxWorks support.
 *
 *   The epToVxLib library uses the multi-processor pipe driver, mpPipeDrv,
 *   for communication between CPUs, and the standard VxWorks pipe driver,
 *   pipeDrv, for communication on the same CPU. Many of the epToVxLib
 *   functions allow the pipe driver to be chosen by providing a pointer
 *   to the appropriate "pipeCreate" function.
 *
 *   It is assumed that a description of the EPICS records known by the
 *   system is contained in array externals pWfsDbCadList, pWfsDbCarList and pWfsDbSirList,
 *   which are defined in wfsDb.h and wfsDb.c
 *
 *   EXTERNAL MODULES:
 *   mpPipeDrv         - Multi-processor pipe driver
 *   timeoutLib         - Timeout library

 *
 *   DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
 *   There are a number of potential deadlock scenarios caused by the way in
 *   which errors and messages are reported. If the EPICS database is used
 *   to maintain an error count (as is done in the Gemini A&G Wavefront
 *   Processing System) then problems may occur if any of the daemon tasks
 *   in this library attempt to report an error or a message. The deadlocks
 *   are avoided explicitly, as described in the comments for
 *   epToVxCaWriteDaemon and epToVxCarDaemon.
 *
 *   I think this library is a lot more complicated than it needs to be. This
 *   library has suffered a lot from memory corruption bugs, caused by the fact
 *   that memory is allocated dynamically in several places, pointers are heavily
 *   used and arithmetic and type conversion are frequently carried out on pointers.
 *   In the long term I think this library should be replaced by something based
 *   around EPICS device support, and the pipe-based method of communicating database
 *   information should be replaced by a simpler shared memory technique.
 *   SMB - 1 July 1998.
 *
 *   BUGS:
 *   The Channel Access ID structures for EPICS SIR records can get corrupted,
 *   and I have found this happens most frequently when this library is used
 *   with the DEBUG compiler flag defined. I have spent several months debugging
 *   this library but have not yet managed to track this problem down. I suspect
 *   it is related to the memory corruption bugs I have been seeing (as described
 *   in the "BUGS" section of epToVxCaWrite and epToVxCaWriteDaemon).
 *
 *   I am guarding against the memory corruption, for the time being,
 *   by allocating some padding space at the end of every command packet, data packet
 *   and update packet. I suspect some functions are writing beyond the end of these
 *   packets. Unfortunately, this work around can only guard against memory corruptions
 *   which happen within the padding space.
 *   SMB - 1 July 1998.
 *
 *   The memory corruption has been found to be entirely within the channel access
 *   data structures. I have worked around it by commenting out the calls to channel
 *   access in epToVxCaWriteDaemon and epToVxCarDaemon and replacing them with
 *   database access calls.
 *   SMB - 7 July 1998.
