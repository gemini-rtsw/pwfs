 * MODULE NAME:
 * wfsSite
 *
 * FILENAME:
 * wfsSite.c
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Wavefront sensing site defintion - GEMINI NORTH VERSION.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This module initialises the data structure which contains a definition 
 * of the CPU configuration at the current site, consisting of
 *   - the VxWorks target name for the processor;
 *   - the target architecture 
 *   - the ethernet address (defined using an IPADDR_TO_HEX(a,b,d,c) macro);
 *   - the processor clock speed in Hz;
 *   - the amount of local RAM in bytes; and
 *   - a collection of flags describing the behaviour of the VME interface.
 *   which MUST be defined correctly for each site before the wavefront
 *   sensing system will function.
 *
 *   The data structure is initialised in wfsSite.c rather than wfsSite.h 
 *   because of the programming convention that header files only declare 
 *   objects and do not allocate memory space.
 *
 *   THIS FILE IS NOT RELEVANT AS LONG AS MPPIPEDRV AND SYSEXTLIB ARE NOT 
 *   BEING USED.
 *
 *   FUNCTION NAME(S):
 *   None
 *
 *   NOTES:
 *   In its present form there needs to be a separate copy of this module
 *   for each site at which the AGWPS software will run, which leads to the
 *   risk that the various copies of this library will diverge. Can this sort of
 *   information not be downloaded from a file or defined from a function call 
 *   at boot time?    SMB - 26 Nov 97.
 *
 *   The definitions in this file must be modified to reflect the
 *   actual cpu configuration at your site. See definitions below.
 *
 *   THIS FILE IS ONLY USED WHEN THE MULTI-PROCESSOR PIPE DRIVER AND
 *   SYSEXTLIB ARE BEING USED. OTHERWISE ITS CONTENTS ARE IGNORED.
